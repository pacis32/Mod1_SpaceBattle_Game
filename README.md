 youHero is how you access your ship - (The USS Schwarzenegger)

      The ennemies will have random attributes each time 
      They all are named al something 
      You can shoot them with a laser (youHero.laser() ) - (weak but unlimited)
      or missles (youHero.attack() ) - (stronger but a finite resource)
    
o attack first ship with lasers use/type youHero.laser(al1)
      To attack first ship with missles use/type youHero.attack(al1)
      To laser or missle the second ship replace al1 above with al2
      
        It is the same with subsequent enemies... al3 ... al4 ... al5 ... al6

      
        youHero.laser(al2) ... youHero.laser(al3 ) or youHero.attack(al1) ...
        youHero.attack(al2) and so on ...
   
        To check your hull strength (health) use/type youHero.announceHealth()
    
        Please ignore when undefined appears in the log _-_ HOWEVER _-_ if your
        moves only return undefined then either you are targeting a dead ship or
        you have died please reset to play again (refresh the page).
     
        Your commands must end with a () empty to fix hull or check your health
        ..... you put (the target) inside parenthesis to attack like above.
 

      Can you save the Earth and destroy all 6 Alien ships ?
